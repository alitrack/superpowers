# Superpowers for Codex

Guide for using Superpowers with OpenAI Codex via native skill discovery.

## Quick Install

Tell Codex:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

## Manual Installation

### Prerequisites

- OpenAI Codex CLI
- Git

### Steps

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/obra/superpowers.git ~/.codex/superpowers
   ```

2. Create the skills symlink:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
   ln -s ~/.codex/superpowers/skills ~/.agents/skills/superpowers
   ```

3. Restart Codex.

4. **For subagent skills** (optional): Skills like `dispatching-parallel-agents` and `subagent-driven-development` require Codex's multi-agent feature. Add to your Codex config:
   ```toml
   [features]
   multi_agent = true
   ```

### Windows

Use a junction instead of a symlink (works without Developer Mode):

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills"
cmd /c mklink /J "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills\superpowers" "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\superpowers\skills"
```

## How It Works

Codex has native skill discovery — it scans `~/.agents/skills/` at startup, parses SKILL.md frontmatter, and loads skills on demand. Superpowers skills are made visible through a single symlink:

```
~/.agents/skills/superpowers/ → ~/.codex/superpowers/skills/
```

The `using-superpowers` skill is discovered automatically and enforces skill usage discipline — no additional configuration needed.

## Usage

Skills are discovered automatically. Codex activates them when:
- You mention a skill by name (e.g., "use brainstorming")
- The task matches a skill's description
- The `using-superpowers` skill directs Codex to use one

### Personal Skills

Create your own skills in `~/.agents/skills/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills/my-skill
```

Create `~/.agents/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Use when [condition] - [what it does]
---

# My Skill

[Your skill content here]
```

The `description` field is how Codex decides when to activate a skill automatically — write it as a clear trigger condition.

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/.codex/superpowers && git pull
```

Skills update instantly through the symlink.

## Uninstalling

```bash
rm ~/.agents/skills/superpowers
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills\superpowers"
```

Optionally delete the clone: `rm -rf ~/.codex/superpowers` (Windows: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\superpowers"`).

## Troubleshooting

### Skills not showing up

1. Verify the symlink: `ls -la ~/.agents/skills/superpowers`
2. Check skills exist: `ls ~/.codex/superpowers/skills`
3. Restart Codex — skills are discovered at startup

### Windows junction issues

Junctions normally work without special permissions. If creation fails, try running PowerShell as administrator.

## Repo-Local Brainstorm Workbench

This repository contains an experimental browser-hosted brainstorming workbench used for validating a real Codex-plus-skills session flow behind a decision-tree canvas.

Run it from the repository root:

```bash
BRAINSTORM_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
BRAINSTORM_PORT=3341 \
BRAINSTORM_URL_HOST=localhost \
BRAINSTORM_DIR=/tmp/brainstorm-live-3341 \
BRAINSTORM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=0 \
node skills/brainstorming/scripts/server.cjs
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3341/app
```

If you change the graph UI source, rebuild the served bundle:

```bash
npm --prefix skills/brainstorming/web-client install
npm --prefix skills/brainstorming/web-client run build
```

High-value regressions for this surface:

```bash
node tests/brainstorm-server/web-product.test.js
node tests/brainstorm-server/web-mainstage-state.test.js
node tests/brainstorm-server/web-session-manager.test.js
```
